Locale Plugin
#############

About
=====

The Locale plugin allows your QuickApps site to be presented in
languages other than the default English, and to be multilingual. The
Locale plugin works by maintaining a database of translations, and
examining text as it is about to be displayed. When a translation of the
text is available in the language to be displayed, the translation is
displayed rather than the original text. When a translation is
unavailable, the original text is displayed.

Uses
====

Configuring a multilingual site
-------------------------------

Language negotiation allows your site to automatically change language
based on path used for each request. Users may (optionally) select their
preferred language on their *My account page*, and your site can be
configured to honor a web browser's preferred language settings.
