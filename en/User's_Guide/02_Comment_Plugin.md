Comment Plugin
--------------


### About

The Comment plugin allows users to comment on site content, set commenting
defaults and permissions, and moderate comments.


### Uses


#### Default and custom settings

Each content type can have its own default comment settings configured as:
**Open** to allow new comments and show existing ones, **Closed** to prevent new comments
and do not show existing ones, or **Read only** to show existing comments but prevent
new ones. These defaults will apply to all new content created (changes to the
settings on existing content must be done manually). Other comment settings can
also be customized per content type, and can be overridden for any given item of
content.


#### Comment approval

All comments are placed in the Unapproved comments queue, until a user who has
the proper permissions will publishes them, mark them as spam, move them to trash
bin or just deletes them.
