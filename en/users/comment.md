About
=====

The Comment module allows users to comment on site content, set commenting defaults and permissions, and moderate comments.


Uses
====


Default and custom settings
---------------------------

Each content type can have its own default comment settings configured as:  
Open to allow new comments, Hidden to hide existing comments and prevent new comments, or Closed but prevent new comments and do not show
existing ones.  
These defaults will apply to all new content created (changes to the settings on existing content must be done manually).  
Other comment settings can also be customized per content type, and can be overridden for any given item of content. 


Comment approval
----------------

All comments are placed in the Unapproved comments queue, until a user who has the proper permissions will publishes or deletes them.
Published comments can be bulk managed on the Published comments administration page.
