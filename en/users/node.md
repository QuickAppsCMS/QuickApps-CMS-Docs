About
=====

The Node module manages the creation, editing, deletion, settings, and display of the main site content. Content items managed by the Node
module are typically displayed as pages on your site, and include a title, some meta-data (author, creation time, content type, etc.), and
optional fields containing text or other data (fields are managed by the Field module).


Uses
====


Creating content
----------------

When new content is created, the Node module records basic information about the content, including the author, date of creation, and the
Content type. It also manages the publishing options, which define whether or not the content is published, promoted to the front page of
the site, and/or sticky at the top of content lists. Default settings can be configured for each type of content on your site. 


Creating custom content types
-----------------------------

The Node module gives users with the proper permission the ability to create new content types in addition to the default ones already
configured. Creating custom content types allows you the flexibility to add fields and configure default settings that suit the differing
needs of various site content. 


Administering content
---------------------

The Content administration page allows you to review and bulk manage your site content.
