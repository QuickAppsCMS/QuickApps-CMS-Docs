What is QuickAppsCMS
####################

QuickAppsCMS is a free open source Content Management System released under GPL
license and inspired by most of the popular CMS. It's quick to setup, quick to
configure and extend. QuickAppsCMS is built using modern Open Source libraries and
techniques; its core is powered by CakePHP MVC framework.

Basically, there are three groups of users we’ve created QuickAppsCMS for:

- End users: that want to focus mostly on creating and editing contents.

- Designers: that want to create custom markups and change the look & feel of the
  CMS.

- Developers: who need a system that’s easy to set up and configure, that’s easy to
  manage and maintain, but is also flexible and versatile.
