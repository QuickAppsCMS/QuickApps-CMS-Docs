Aspects
#######

    In computing, aspect-oriented programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm which
    isolates secondary or supporting functions from the main program's business
    logic. It aims to increase modularity by allowing the separation of cross-
    cutting concerns, forming a basis for aspect-oriented software development.
