Welcome to the official QuickAppsCMS documentation. This manual assumes that
you have a general understanding of PHP, object-oriented programming (OOP)
and `CakePHP 3 framework <http://cakephp.org/>`__ .

The QuickBook is an openly developed and community editable documentation
project. We hope to maintain a high level of quality, validity and accuracy for
the documentation.
