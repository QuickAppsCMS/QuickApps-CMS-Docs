Welcome to the official QuickAppsCMS documentation. This manual assumes that
you have a general understanding of PHP and a basic understanding of
object-oriented programming (OOP) and CakePHP v3.0 framework.

The QuickBook is an openly developed and community editable documentation
project. We hope to maintain a high level of quality, validity and accuracy for
the documentation.
